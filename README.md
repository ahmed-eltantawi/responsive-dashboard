# 📊 Responsive Dashboard

A **Flutter** dashboard application built as a training project to practice **Responsive & Adaptive UI** design. This was a task for the **IEEE** team — implementing a main dashboard that adapts seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile screens.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🖥️ **Desktop Layout** — Full sidebar navigation with expanded dashboard view
- 📱 **Tablet Layout** — Compact sidebar with adjusted content grid
- 📲 **Mobile Layout** — Bottom/drawer navigation with stacked content
- 📊 **Dashboard Cards** — Info cards, charts (SVG), and announcements
- 🎨 **Custom Fonts** — Roboto, Public Sans, Poppins, Mulish
- 🖼️ **SVG Assets** — Scalable vector icons and chart graphics
- 🔍 **Device Preview** — Test responsiveness using `device_preview` package

## 🧠 What I Learned & Applied

### 📐 Responsive vs Adaptive UI
- **Responsive UI** — The layout *flexes and scales* based on screen size (e.g., font sizes, spacing, card ratios adjust dynamically)
- **Adaptive UI** — The layout *completely changes structure* based on breakpoints (e.g., showing a different layout for mobile vs desktop)

### 🔧 Key Concepts Applied

#### 1. `LayoutBuilder` + Breakpoints
Used `LayoutBuilder` to read the available `maxWidth` constraints and switch between **3 completely different layouts** based on breakpoints:
- `< 600px` → Mobile Layout
- `600px – 900px` → Tablet Layout
- `≥ 900px` → Desktop Layout

#### 2. `MediaQuery`
Used `MediaQuery.sizeOf(context)` to conditionally show/hide widgets — for example, showing `MobileAppBar` only when `width <= 600`.

#### 3. Custom Responsive Font Sizing
Built a `getResponsiveSize()` utility function that:
- Calculates a **scale factor** based on screen width for each breakpoint range
- Uses `.clamp()` to keep font sizes within **80% – 120%** of the base size
- Prevents text from becoming too small or too large on extreme screen sizes

#### 4. `Expanded` with Flex Ratios
Used `Expanded` with specific **flex values** (like `flex: 255` for drawer, `flex: 1162` for body) to create proportional layouts that match the Figma design precisely.

#### 5. Adaptive Navigation
Implemented **3 different navigation patterns** for the same app:
- 🖥️ **Desktop** → Full sidebar drawer with text labels + icons
- 📱 **Tablet** → Icon-only compact sidebar with selected state indicator
- 📲 **Mobile** → Custom `AppBar` (no sidebar at all)

#### 6. `GridView` with Dynamic `crossAxisCount`
Used `GridView.builder` with `SliverGridDelegateWithFixedCrossAxisCount` where `crossAxisCount` changes based on `isMobile` flag — showing cards in **2 columns on mobile** vs **4 columns on desktop/tablet**.

#### 7. `FittedBox`
Used `FittedBox` to ensure widgets like images and logos scale down gracefully without overflow.

#### 8. `CustomScrollView` + Slivers
Used `CustomScrollView` with `SliverToBoxAdapter` and `SliverList.builder` for efficient scrollable layouts in the drawer.

#### 9. `device_preview` Package
Integrated [device_preview](https://pub.dev/packages/device_preview) to test the app on various virtual devices directly during development (enabled only in debug mode via `!kReleaseMode`).

#### 10. Clean Architecture Separation
Organized code into a clear structure:
- **`layout/`** → Adaptive layout logic (which layout to show)
- **`views/`** → Screen-specific views (desktop body, tablet drawer, etc.)
- **`widgets/`** → Reusable UI components (info cards, search bar, etc.)
- **`utils/`** → Helpers (responsive sizing, colors, styles, asset paths)
- **`models/`** → Data models
